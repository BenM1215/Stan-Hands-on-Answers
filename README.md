# Stan-Hands-on-Answers

3 hands-on R notebooks covering:

1). Basic linear regression. 

2). Fitting a model to data simulated from an exponential function.

3). Fitting a differential equation model to data simulated from an exponential function.

These exercises were delivered during an introduction to nonlinear mixed effects modelling workshop at the Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health.
